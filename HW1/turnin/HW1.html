<h1> Randomly moving on a 10 x 10 grid</h1>

<!-- Explanation of features/purpose to user -->
<h4>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The following simulates pseudo-random movement of a marker on a 10 x 10 grid.
<br><br>
The marker will start in the lower left corner <span style="color:#00FF00;">[0,0]</span> with its goal destination being the upper right corner <span style="color:#00FF00;">[9,9]</span>.
<br><br>
Random movements are generated. These movements are each one cell in the direction of either up, down, left or right.
<br><br>
If the random movement remains on the grid, the marker is moved, a step is counted and the newly visited cell of the grid records a visit.
<br><br>
If the movement would place the marker off of the grid, the marker remains in its current position prior to the illegal movement, a step is counted and the last valid cell records another visit.
<br><br>
Upon reaching the upper right cell or 1,000,000 movements (whichever occurs first) the simulation is completed. If both occur at the same step, this will be indicated on the screen.
<br>
</p>
</h4>
<p>The simulation is run when the page loads.
<br>
Whenever "Click here to re-run" is pressed, a new simulation is started.
Statistics displayed upon completion are:
<br>
<ol>
<li>Total number of steps taken
<li>Minimum number of visits to any given cell
<li>Maximum number of visits to any given cell
</ol>
</p>
