For Homework 2, I created the program using JavaScript, but did not load it on the web.
Please use W3 JavaScript tutorial system to run my program.

Note:
The refresh button does not function properly on W3. It reloads the window in the buttonâ€™s active frame. This does, however, function properly if the entire text of the program is saved as html and opened in a browser.

Thank you,
Tim M. Lael
