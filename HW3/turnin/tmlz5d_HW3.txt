For Homework 3, I created the program using JavaScript, but did not load it on the web.
Please use W3 JavaScript tutorial system to run my program.


To Run:
Default values of 10w x 10h and 10 runs may be used by simply pressing "Run SImulation" button.

For more interesting output, change default values using the supplied text input boxes.
Accept entries by pressing the "Accept Input" button, then run the simulation by pressing "Run Simulation"


Thank you,
Tim M. Lael
